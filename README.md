# FastAPI

experimenting with fastapi

## ENV
create a `.env` file in the main directory
you will need to add:
```SECRET_IDENTITY='<secret stuff>'```
If you want it to work, I literally used it to show you can hide whatever you like in there.

## RUN

Make sure you have docker desktop up and running.
```bash
$ docker compose up --build
```

then click the linked location that fets shown in the terminal.

## TESTED
* docker environment working
* env working
